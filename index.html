                            <li>Became a lead developer on an internally used framework for Jenkins 2.0 to automate CI/CD across
                              teams and organizations with differing requirements (e.g. the creation of AWS ECS stacks with blue/green deployment capability,
                              creation of serverless (AWS Lambda) application stacks with blue/green or canary deployment capability that leveraged function versioning and aliasing).</li>

                              support to teams, developers and colleagues.</li>

maturity, importantly revealing which tools teams had integrated (or failed to integrate) into their projects for asserting code quality,
security scanning, application performance monitoring, logging, etc., as well as showing basic KPI metrics such as build pass ratio,
number of active contributors and commit velocity.</li>
